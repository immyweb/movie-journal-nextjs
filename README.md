## Movie Journal NextJS version

A NextJS port of the Movie Journal app using SSR and Typescript.
At the moment it requires the Movie Journal API to also be running.
I may port over the API to this project in the future.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
